## What is On Cinema At the Cinema?

On Cinema at the Cinema is a long running comedy series from Tim Heidecker, Gregg Turkington, and Eric Notarnicola. 
It starts out as a movie review show in the vein of Siskel & Ebert, but quickly goes off the rails as Tim uses the show
to talk about his health problems, preach his hypocritical right wing political views, play the terrible rock songs he's 
written, and so much more -- all to Gregg's chagrin.

Recent seasons are available on the members-only streaming site [HEINetwork.tv](https://www.heinetwork.tv)

## Purpose

This website was built as a continuation of the list of On Cinema Ratings that were formerly part of 
[this Wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_On_Cinema_episodes)

Unfortunately the content of that page did not comply with Wikipedia's editorial rules, leaving us all to wonder:
"Should I see a movie this weekend? Aaaah!"
